#Initial Conclusions Summary

#Data is nonparametric (does not follow Gaussian distribution)- concluded from histogram, QQ-plot, and Shapiro-Wilk tests

#There is a lot of repeat locations in the data set, or locations that are close to one another. 
#Needed to combine location/area values for overall totals.
#Further research could look into the specific lat longs of each location if available

#There is 3657 different variables, where 69 are samples with 53 types of data points/variables. 
#Within the dataset, the d-types are 47 integer, 4 float, and 2 objects. 
#There is no NaN values in the dataset. 

#There is a lot of variation in the data with drastic outliers, where Barraud Park had noticble outliers in terms of trash weight/items collected,
#and volunteer numbers and hours in 2022. 
#Norfolk Collegiate (Lafayette Park-Boat Ramp) had an outlier of the most miles covered (10 miles). 

#General correlation between each of the different locations/areas and other variables (excluding dates) is positive (PCA test). 

#Specifically, Spearmans correlation and Scatterplots suggest that there's a positive correlation,
#where higher volunteer impact & area coverage is correlated with more litter items and weight collected

#There is no correlation between litter and dates, collection happened in the Fall/Winter months, 
#and even in different years there was no significant correlation
#Time of collection has no correlation with amount and weight of trash collected as well as volunteer number and hours.

#Within the Barrod Park Area (combined overall totals),
#The majority of trash collected in Barraud Park is metal bottle caps (14402 and 23.7%), 
#followed by cigarettte butts (11495, 18.9%) and then plastic pieces (10281,16.9%).
#There isn't any data about individual weight distribution but that would be interesting to see
